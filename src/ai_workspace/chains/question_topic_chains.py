    ### Guidelines:
    - Focus on the **core academic intent** behind the question.
    - Each query should:
    - Be short, specific, and non-redundant
    - Highlight a distinct aspect or interpretation of the question
    - Help retrieve relevant topics, concepts, or subject areas

    ### Context:
    - The database contains topic names, brief descriptions, and relevant academic disciplines.

    You are a grader assessing whether a newly generated topic is sufficiently distinct from existing topics in a database.

    ### Task:
        Decide whether a newly-proposed topic should be **accepted** as a distinct label
    or **rejected** as merely a re-wording / duplicate of topics already in the
    database.

    🔹  You receive  
    1. **new_topic** – the candidate topic string.  
    2. **nearby_topics[]** – a short list of existing topics judged most similar.

     What counts as “unique enough”  
    
   | Situation | Return |
    |-----------|--------|
    | The new topic introduces a **new sub-area or sub-topic** (e.g. “Shear Force Diagrams” vs. existing “Bending Moment Diagrams”). | `"yes"` |
    | It focuses on a **different concept, method, or application**, even if nested under the same broad field. | `"yes"` |
    | The only difference is superficial wording, plural/singular, punctuation, or synonym (e.g. “Vector Addition” vs. “Addition of Vectors”). | `"no"` |
    | It simply adds a qualifier that doesn’t change scope (e.g. “Basic Statics” vs. “Statics”). | `"no"` |
    | **No nearby_topics are supplied** (the list is empty). | `"yes"` (assume unique) |

    > *Rule of thumb:* If a subject-matter expert would create a **separate section** for it in a syllabus or textbook, mark **yes**; otherwise **no**.

    - **"yes"**  – keep the topic as a distinct entry.  
    - **"no"**   – too similar; merge or revise.

    You are a classification model tasked with generating a new academic topic based on the provided question.

    ### Objective:
    - Analyze the content and intent of the question.
    - Generate:
    1. A **concise topic name** that broadly classifies the question.
    2. A **short description** explaining what the topic focuses on.
    3. A list of relevant **engineering disciplines** where this topic is commonly encountered.

    ### Guidelines:
    - The topic should reflect the **core academic concept** behind the question (e.g., "Thermodynamics", "Control Systems").
    - The description should be 1–2 sentences summarizing **what the topic covers** in an educational or practical context.
    - The list of disciplines should include areas such as Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, etc., where this topic is relevant.
    - Avoid overly specific or narrow terms—keep the topic name broad enough for classification purposes.
    - If unsure, use academic reasoning to infer the best general category.

    ### Output Format:
    Return a JSON object with the following fields:
    - `"name"`: A concise topic name.
    - `"description"`: A brief summary of what the topic covers.
    - `"disciplines"`: A list of engineering disciplines where this topic is applicable.
